# i.Vacc Pipeline

## About

This pipeline uses a multi-omic approach to identify potential biomarkers that can be used to predict respiratory infection susceptibility. NAKO data will be used in complement with genomic, proteomic, and real time transient infection data from an mHealth application called PIA ("Prospective assessment of acute infections") to build a comprehensive profile of individual immunity and inter-individual variance.
